## Installation

npm install

## Usage

Run npm start.

This will allow users to view, create, update, and delete users and associated thoughts via an API. Reactions can be created or deleted for thoughts, and friends can be created or deleted for users. When a user is deleted, all associated thoughts are deleted from the MondoDB database, and all users who had that deleted user in their friend list will have their friend list updated to remove that deleted user.
